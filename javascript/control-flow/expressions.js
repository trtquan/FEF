          // but where this occurs in the original function,

            // JS will try to find that in the object it self and if it cannot found,
            // it will look in the object's prototype  ob it's parent so it moves up in the
            // prototype chain, this continues until no more prototype to look at, which is null
            // null is the only one that has no prototype
            // there is final link in prototype chain return undefined

        // DOM event handler
          // this is set to the element the vent fired from
